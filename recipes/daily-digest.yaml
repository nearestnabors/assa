  Check my Twitter activity from the last 24 hours using the twitter_daily_digest tool.
  
  Summarize what I need to know:
  
  1. **Questions or requests I should respond to**
     - Prioritize by: follower count, relevance to my work, time sensitivity
     - Flag anything from verified accounts or frequent collaborators
  
  2. **Opportunities**
     - Speaking invitations
     - Collaboration requests
     - Interesting threads where I could add value
  
  3. **Notable engagement on my posts**
     - Only mention if something is performing unusually well
     - Skip routine likes/retweets
  
  **Rules:**
  - Skip promotional spam and low-value mentions
  - Be concise — I want to read this in under 2 minutes
  - If anything needs a response, offer to draft replies
  - Don't list everything, curate what actually matters
  
  Format your summary like a briefing from a smart assistant, not a data dump.
