# ASSA: Anti-Social Social Agent

An MCP server that provides Twitter integration with rich UI components for [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose) and other MCP-compatible AI agents.

## What is ASSA?

Social media companies weaponize interfaces against humans (infinite scroll, notification anxiety, algorithmic rage bait). Agents are immune to psychological manipulation—they just execute.

ASSA reclaims the social web by:
- **Daily Digest**: Know what happened on Twitter without opening the app
- **Post with Approval**: Agent drafts, you review a rich preview, then approve

## Features

- 🔐 **OAuth via Arcade**: Secure authentication without handling tokens yourself
- 📊 **Rich UI Cards**: Mentions and DMs displayed with avatars, text, engagement metrics
- ✍️ **Tweet Previews**: See exactly what will post, with character count
- 🔁 **Human-in-the-Loop**: Nothing posts without your explicit approval

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.0+ (or Node.js 20+)
- [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose) (or another MCP-compatible agent)
- [Arcade.dev](https://arcade.dev) API key

### Setup

1. **Get your Arcade API key** at [arcade.dev](https://arcade.dev)

2. Clone and install:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/assa-mcp
   cd assa-mcp
   bun install
   bun run build
   ```

3. Add to Goose (see below)

### Add to Goose

Add to `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`:

```yaml
extensions:
  assa:
    type: stdio
    command: node
    args: ["/path/to/assa-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    env:
      ARCADE_API_KEY: your_api_key_here      # <-- Required!
      ARCADE_USER_ID: you@example.com        # <-- Required! Your Arcade account email
```

**Important:**
- `ARCADE_API_KEY` - Required. Get yours at [arcade.dev](https://arcade.dev)
- `ARCADE_USER_ID` - Required. Must match the email address of your Arcade account. This is used to link OAuth authorizations to your account.

#### Alternative: CLI setup
```bash
goose configure
# Select "Add Extension"
# Select "Command-line Extension"
# Name: assa
# Command: node /path/to/assa-mcp/dist/index.js
# Then manually add the env section to the config file
```

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode (auto-reload)
bun dev

# Type check
bun typecheck

# Lint check
bun check

# Run tests
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun test:watch

# Build for production
bun run build
```

## Testing

ASSA uses [Bun's built-in test runner](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test) with Jest-compatible syntax.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
bun test:watch

# Run a specific test file
bun test src/__tests__/utils/time.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
bun test --grep "snowflake"
```

### Test Structure

Tests are located in `src/__tests__/` mirroring the source structure:

```
src/
├── __tests__/
│   ├── state/
│   │   └── manager.test.ts    # State management tests
│   ├── tools/
│   │   └── dismiss-conversation.test.ts
│   └── utils/
│       └── time.test.ts       # Time utility tests
├── state/
│   └── manager.ts
├── tools/
│   └── ...
└── utils/
    └── time.ts
```

### Writing Tests

Create a `.test.ts` file in the appropriate `__tests__` subdirectory:

```typescript
import { describe, expect, test } from "bun:test";
import { myFunction } from "../../utils/my-module.js";

describe("myFunction", () => {
  test("does something expected", () => {
    const result = myFunction("input");
    expect(result).toBe("expected output");
  });
});
```

### Mocking

Use `mock.module()` to mock Node.js modules:

```typescript
import { mock } from "bun:test";

// Mock before importing the module that uses it
mock.module("node:os", () => ({
  homedir: () => "/tmp/test-home",
}));

// Now import your module
import { myFunction } from "../../state/manager.js";
```

### Test Isolation

When testing stateful modules, use unique IDs and clean up between tests:

```typescript
import { beforeEach } from "bun:test";

let testCounter = 0;
function uniqueId(prefix: string): string {
  return `${prefix}_${Date.now()}_${++testCounter}`;
}

beforeEach(() => {
  clearState(); // Reset shared state
});
```

## Getting an Arcade API Key

1. Go to [arcade.dev](https://arcade.dev)
2. Create an account
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Create a new key
5. Add it to your `.env` file

## Roadmap

### Next Steps

- [ ] Migrate to React components
- [ ] Make Authorize button more attractive
- [ ] Get a proper style system implemented like ShadCN
- [ ] Make the "reply UI" smaller:
  - [ ] Add small "dismiss" and "reply" icons in the lower left corner of each card
  - [ ] Clicking "reply" replaces icons with input area and reply button
  - [ ] Clicking outside closes the UI and brings back the icons
- [ ] If a Tweet is a reply, show the original tweet as a stylized quote above the comment
- [ ] If a tweet quotes another tweet, show the quoted tweet below the comment

### Phase 2

- [ ] Add `X.GetMutedUsers` to Arcade to filter muted accounts from conversations
- [ ] Add media expansion to Arcade to show images in tweets
- [ ] Browser automation for "Following" timeline digest (AgentQL/Firecrawl)
- [ ] VIP accounts feature (track specific users)

### Known Limitations

- **No DM support** — Arcade's X integration doesn't include DM access
- **7-day limit** — X search only goes back 7 days
